    <h3>5:Hamstring Injury-</h3>
    <p>A hamstring injury occurs when you strain or pull one of your hamstring muscles â€” the group of three muscles that run along the back of your thigh.

    <h4>Symptoms</h4>
    <p>A hamstring injury typically causes a sudden, sharp pain in the back of your thigh. You might also feel a "popping" or tearing sensation. Swelling and tenderness usually develop within a few hours. You may also experience bruising or discoloration along the back of your leg, as well as muscle weakness or an inability to put weight on your injured leg.</p>
    <h4>Prevention</h4>
    <ul> 
    <p>Try to maintain your body weight to an optimum balance.</p>
      <p> As part of an overall physical conditioning program, regular stretching and strengthening exercises can help minimize your risk of hamstring injury.</p>
      <p> If you have a physically demanding occupation, regular conditioning can help prevent injuries. Ask your doctor about appropriate conditioning exercises.</p>
       <p> elf-care measures such as rest, ice and over-the-counter pain medications are often all you need to relieve the pain and swelling associated with a hamstring injury. Rarely, surgery may be needed to repair a hamstring muscle or tendon.</p>
