    <h2>1.HAMSTRING STRAIN</h2>
    <p>The hamstring are a group of muscles that run down the back of your leg,allowing it to bend at the knee. Hamstring strains can be caused by a number of different activities in cricket; these include fast bowling, fielding and running between the wickets.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO AVOID:</h3>
    <p>In cricket, where a match can be played for hours at a time, it is important to keep the muscles warm and the joints loose; this can be achieved by doing exercises throughout the game. Resting between activities will also reduce the risk of injury; bowlers should have a break after a certain number of overs.</p>

    <p> Like knees, ankles are put under a lot of strain during cricket too. A sprained ankle refers to damaged ligaments and soft tissue. This often happens when the ankle twists inwards and can sometimes occur when bowlers land in old foot marks at the bowling crease or when batsmen turn from running.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO AVOID:</h3>
    <p>Cricketers tape their fingers to avoid injury from the impact of the hard cricket ball. Finger tapes help to propagate the impact of the cricket ball towards the wrist instead of the fingers and thus help in reducing the chance of an injury.</p>
